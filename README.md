# books-library

## Project Description:

-    This project allows user to add books to the library and keep track of read and unread books.
-    Initially the book objects were created using constructor functions in JS.
-    Then in this modification, constructor functions were replaced by the classes to exercise the classes concept.
-    What it does it provides an add book button and after clicking on it it pops up a book form asking for book title, author name, total pages and whether you have read this book or not.
-    Then you can add book or cancel it out using cancel button.
-    Then upon adding book to the library, it gives you option to remove the book from the library.
-    Also for each book it gives you option to toggle "read status" of the book.
